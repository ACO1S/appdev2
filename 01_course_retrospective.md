## 1. What Went Well
- I gained a clearer understanding of React after our instructor explained its fundamentals. The step-by-step discussion of JSX and core concepts helped me understand how React works in actual development.
- Our team was able to successfully pass the presentation. Although there were minor issues in some parts, they did not greatly affect the overall outcome. Instead, we viewed them as opportunities for improvement to further enhance our system.
- In terms of UI/UX, the critiques from the panelists were very helpful. Their feedback allowed me to reflect on my design decisions and improve my perspective. This also sparked my interest in exploring the role of a Business Analyst to better understand project management.

## 2. What Went Wrong / Challenges
- I found the coding part challenging since programming is not my strongest skill. Despite this, I still enjoyed the activities because they allowed me to focus more on design, which aligns with my interest in graphic design and UI/UX.
- Communication within the team was sometimes lacking, especially between the developer and me as the UI/UX designer. Our differing perspectives, along with changes in requirements from the business analyst, caused moments of misalignment.
- Another challenge was the absence of some team members during meetings. This affected our workflow, as the prototype was not reviewed on time, resulting in delayed revisions and added difficulty in the UI/UX process.

## 3. Key Learnings
- I learned that clear and consistent communication is crucial for effective teamwork. Without it, collaboration becomes difficult and productivity is affected.
- Paying close attention to details is also important. Failing to carefully review documentation can lead to confusion and errors during development.
- Lastly, I realized the importance of discipline and responsibility in completing tasks, as individual performance directly affects the entire team.

## 4. Areas for Improvement
- I need to continue practicing JSX and React, particularly in the coding aspect, as this is where I struggle the most.
- I also plan to study more UI/UX principles to further improve the usability and overall quality of my designs.
- Improving my communication skills and being more confident in speaking up will help prevent misunderstandings and misalignment in future projects.

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev 2)
- I aim to learn React Native and understand its core fundamentals, especially since mobile development may differ from web development.
- I expect to face challenges as I transition from web to mobile development, since this area is still new to me.
- Ultimately, I want to become comfortable using this technology, as it is an important part of my course and future career.
